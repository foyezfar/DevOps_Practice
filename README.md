Linux Namespaces: Linux namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that provides a way to create isolated and independent instances of certain system resources. Each namespace provides a separate view or instance of a particular resource, which allows processes within the namespace to have their own isolated environment.
Virtual Interfaces and Bridges: Virtual interfaces provide us with virtualized representations of physical network interfaces; and the bridge gives us the virtual equivalent of a switch.
When we use a Linux bridge, we can connect multiple network namespaces, effectively allowing them to communicate with each other. The bridge operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) and can bridge traffic between multiple interfaces or network namespaces that are part of the same bridge.
With a Linux bridge, we can easily connect additional network namespaces by creating veth pairs (or other interfaces) and connecting one end of each pair to the bridge. This facilitates communication between the different namespaces as if they are part of the same local network.
On the other hand, if we only use veth pairs without a bridge, each pair directly connects two network namespaces. While this allows communication between the connected namespaces, it doesn't provide a straightforward way to extend the network to additional namespaces without creating additional pairs and making direct connections.
Using a Linux Bridge:
•	Allows easy extension of the network by connecting multiple namespaces.
•	Provides a centralized point for bridging traffic between namespaces.
•	Enables more flexible and scalable network configurations.
Using veth pairs without a bridge:
•	Directly connects two namespaces, providing communication between them.
•	Requires creating additional pairs for connecting more namespaces.
•	Can become less scalable and more complex as the number of connections increases.
